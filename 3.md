# Checkout in a nutshell

- Many React client apps using Apollo
- Graphql layer

# Hundreds of Checkout flows which are combinations of

- Integration type
- Merchant/Buyer (settings, country)
- UI/feature experiments

# Many checkout flows are hard to reproduce

- Feature development and bug fixing slows down
- Devs, product managers, designers struggle to verify flows/UI
- Devs spend too much time creating user accounts/flow setups
