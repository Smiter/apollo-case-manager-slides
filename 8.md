# Why development should be against mock API

- Control the speed
- Never down / no internet required
- No cross-team dependency
- Can force it to throw errors to simulate server errors
- Can write fast, reliable app tests
- When I find a bug, I can enhance mock data and test it
- No need for a backend server with a database running.
- No need to care about “QA” being down
